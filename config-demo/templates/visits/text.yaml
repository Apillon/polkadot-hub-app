  **Health & Safety Standards**

  We want to keep health and safety standards in our office on a very high level.

  On April 7th, the legal framework for Corona protection measures expired. This means that the last remaining measures have been discontinued.

  Wearing masks, self-testing and social distancing are no longer mandatory. For your comfort and safety though, we are still providing tests and masks should you want to use them.
